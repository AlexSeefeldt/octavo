# octavo

A collection of small, hacky tools built in an afternoon because I couldn't find something else that did what I wanted. 
These will likely never be maintained or improved. 

#### Project Tenets:
- Each one should take <3 hrs.
- Once it works, it's done. There aren't bonus points for well-written code.
- Self-contained. Each tool should be a single, standalone HTML file. It should work offline. (Including minified source of a library is allowed)
